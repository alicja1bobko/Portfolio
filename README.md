# Personal portfolio site

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## My process

### Built with

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/react.html)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [GSAP3](https://greensock.com/gsap/)
- [FramerMotion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)

### What I learned

A big challenge I set to myself was the hero animation. I used the Landscape from [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Firewatch/comments/b2n39h/firewatch_inspired_landscape/) reddit post and was inspired by [this](https://codepen.io/isladjan/pen/abdyPBw )wonderful Parallax scroll animation. 
I also used Framer Motion to animate subsequent pages. It was a great way to expand my skills in Tailwind.
